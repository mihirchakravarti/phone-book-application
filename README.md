# phone-book-application
A simple implementation of a phone book application which consists of a directory which has user inputed entries
There are two types of users - normal user and an admin, both have different access to the application i.e some 
functions of the phone book application are not accessible by a normal user. There are two csv files in this program, which act 
as the way to confirm whether the user is an admin or a normal user. To clarify, if someone selects that he/she is an admin, then
they will need to login using an username, password, and an email adress (or username, password, and ID for a normal user), the values of
which will be corroborated by the values in the csv file corresponding to each user. A normal user has limited functionalities, as 
mentioned above just to demonstrate the difference between the type of users.
